# ML-Model-Generator🤖

This ML Model Generator is a tool that helps create and train machine learning models using synthetic or uploaded datasets. Here’s a quick rundown of its features:

📊Data Generation: Users can generate synthetic data or upload their own dataset, defining feature names and class categories.

🧪Train-Test Split: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, helping evaluate model performance.

📈Feature Visualization: It provides 2D and 3D visualizations to understand the distribution of features.

📑Model Training & Comparison: Multiple models (like Extra Trees Classifier, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, etc.) are trained and compared based on accuracy and other metrics.

🚀Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are displayed for various models.

💾Download Options: Users can download the original or scaled dataset and save trained models.
